# fuckmyclassic

fuckmyclassic prospects to be an all-in-one modification tool for NES and SNES Classic Mini systems. fuckmyclassic is written in Java on top of the Spring and Java FX frameworks, and is fully cross-platform between Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

fuckmyclassic is still *very* much a work-in-progress. Very few things work, and the primary focus at the moment is library management and game syncing, though very basic FEL/memboot functionality is in place as well.

At the moment, outside contributions are not being accepted. This is open-source primarily for archival purposes. That being said, if you intend to contribute in the future, please take note of the existing code styles and techniques, particularly around dependency injection. fuckmyclassic aims to be highly scalable so it can easily handle tens of thousands of games in its libraries.
